= XDG-compliant ini file for solarized color definitions =
== What? ==
Exposes the superb "solarized" color palette through a simple ini-style
config file, allowing other programs to easily obtain the right color definitions.
(as seen on http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized#the-values)
Specifically, shell scripts can just source the file.
As for the XDG part, see http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html
